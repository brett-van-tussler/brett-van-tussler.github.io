# AMP/ACMG Guidelines for Variant Classification

## Overview

The Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) and American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) have established standardized guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. These guidelines provide a framework for classifying genetic variants based on their clinical significance.

## Five-Tier Classification System

1. **Pathogenic (P)**
   - Strong evidence supporting disease-causing nature
   - Multiple lines of evidence indicating variant's role in disease

2. **Likely Pathogenic (LP)**
   - Strong evidence suggesting disease-causing nature
   - Not enough evidence for definitive pathogenic classification

3. **Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS)**
   - Insufficient or conflicting evidence for classification
   - Cannot be definitively categorized as benign or pathogenic

4. **Likely Benign (LB)**
   - Evidence suggests non-pathogenic nature
   - Not enough evidence for definitive benign classification

5. **Benign (B)**
   - Strong evidence supporting non-pathogenic nature
   - Multiple lines of evidence indicating variant's harmless nature

## Evidence Categories

### Population Data
- Allele frequency in population databases
- Presence in healthy individuals
- Ethnic-specific variations

### Computational and Predictive Data
- In silico prediction tools
- Conservation scores
- Splice site predictions

### Functional Data
- Functional studies
- Expression studies
- Animal models

### Segregation Data
- Co-segregation with disease in families
- De novo occurrence

### Other Database Sources
- Disease-specific databases
- Clinical databases
- Literature reports

## Specific Criteria

### Very Strong Evidence of Pathogenicity (PVS1)
- Null variant in a gene where LOF is a known mechanism of disease

### Strong Evidence of Pathogenicity (PS1-PS4)
- PS1: Same amino acid change as established pathogenic variant
- PS2: De novo variant with confirmed paternity and maternity
- PS3: Well-established functional studies show damaging effect
- PS4: Variant prevalence in affected individuals significantly higher than controls

### Moderate Evidence of Pathogenicity (PM1-PM6)
- PM1: Located in mutational hot spot or functional domain
- PM2: Absent from controls in population databases
- PM3: For recessive disorders, detected in trans with pathogenic variant
- PM4: Protein length changes
- PM5: Novel missense change at amino acid where different change is pathogenic
- PM6: Assumed de novo without confirmation of paternity and maternity

## Best Practices

1. **Documentation**
   - Clearly document evidence used for classification
   - Note any limitations or uncertainties

2. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically review classifications as new evidence emerges
   - Update classifications when necessary

3. **Communication**
   - Clear reporting of classification and evidence
   - Appropriate clinical context
