    "# SQL Window Functions: A Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions are powerful SQL features that allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, window functions don't cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the rows retain their separate identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Window Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions operate on a set of rows and return a single value for each row from the underlying query. The set of rows is called a \"window\" and is defined by the `OVER` clause.\n",

    "1. **Window functions don't reduce the number of rows** - unlike GROUP BY aggregates\n",
    "2. **PARTITION BY** divides the result set into groups for the window function\n",
    "3. **ORDER BY** within OVER determines the order for ranking and frame calculations\n",
    "4. **Frame specifications** (ROWS/RANGE) control which rows are included in calculations\n",
    "5. **Ranking functions** handle ties differently (ROW_NUMBER vs RANK vs DENSE_RANK)\n",
    "6. **LAG/LEAD** are perfect for comparing current row with previous/next rows\n",
    "7. **Window functions can be combined** with CTEs for complex analytical queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions are essential for analytical SQL and are supported by most modern databases including PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL 8.0+, and SQLite 3.25+.\n",
