# SQL Window Functions: A Comprehensive Guide

Window functions are powerful SQL features that allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, window functions don't cause rows to become grouped into a single output row â€” the rows retain their separate identities.

## What are Window Functions?

Window functions operate on a set of rows and return a single value for each row from the underlying query. The set of rows is called a "window" and is defined by the `OVER` clause.

### Basic Syntax
```sql
function_name([arguments]) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    [ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...]
    [ROWS|RANGE frame_specification]
)
```

## Setup: Import Required Libraries

First, let's import the necessary Python libraries to make this notebook interactive and runnable:


```python
!pip install sqlite3
```

    [31mERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement sqlite3 (from versions: none)[0m[31m
    [0m[31mERROR: No matching distribution found for sqlite3[0m[31m
    [0m


```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Create an in-memory SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')

# Helper function to execute SQL and display results
def run_sql(query, description=None):
    if description:
        print(f"\n{description}")
        print("=" * len(description))
    
    try:
        result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
        print(result.to_string(index=False))
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

print("âœ… Libraries imported and database connection established!")
```

## Sample Data Setup

Let's create some sample data to work with:


```python
# Create the sales table
create_table_query = """
CREATE TABLE sales (
    employee_id INTEGER,
    employee_name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_amount REAL
);
"""

conn.execute(create_table_query)

# Insert sample data
insert_data_query = """
INSERT INTO sales VALUES
(1, 'Alice Johnson', 'Sales', '2024-01-15', 1500.00),
(2, 'Bob Smith', 'Sales', '2024-01-16', 2200.00),
(3, 'Carol Davis', 'Marketing', '2024-01-17', 1800.00),
(1, 'Alice Johnson', 'Sales', '2024-02-10', 1750.00),
(4, 'David Wilson', 'Marketing', '2024-02-12', 2100.00),
(2, 'Bob Smith', 'Sales', '2024-02-15', 1900.00),
(5, 'Eva Brown', 'IT', '2024-03-01', 2500.00),
(3, 'Carol Davis', 'Marketing', '2024-03-05', 1600.00),
(1, 'Alice Johnson', 'Sales', '2024-03-10', 2000.00),
(6, 'Frank Miller', 'IT', '2024-03-15', 2300.00);
"""

conn.execute(insert_data_query)
conn.commit()

# Display the data
run_sql("SELECT * FROM sales ORDER BY sale_date", "Sample Sales Data")
```

## Types of Window Functions

### 1. Ranking Functions

These functions assign ranks to rows within a partition.


```python
# ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns unique sequential integers
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    sale_amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as row_num,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as dept_row_num
FROM sales
ORDER BY sale_amount DESC
"""

run_sql(query, "ROW_NUMBER() Example")
```


```python
# RANK(): Assigns ranks with gaps for ties
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    sale_amount,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as rank_with_gaps,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as dept_rank
FROM sales
ORDER BY sale_amount DESC
"""

run_sql(query, "RANK() Example")
```


```python
# DENSE_RANK(): Assigns ranks without gaps for ties
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    sale_amount,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as dense_rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as dept_dense_rank
FROM sales
ORDER BY sale_amount DESC
"""

run_sql(query, "DENSE_RANK() Example")
```


```python
# NTILE(): Divides rows into specified number of groups
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    sale_amount,
    NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as quartile,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as quartile_4
FROM sales
ORDER BY sale_amount DESC
"""

run_sql(query, "NTILE() Example")
```

### 2. Aggregate Window Functions

These functions perform calculations across the window frame.


```python
# SUM() with different window frames
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    sale_date,
    sale_amount,
    SUM(sale_amount) OVER () as total_sales,
    SUM(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_total,
    SUM(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) as running_total
FROM sales
ORDER BY sale_date
"""

run_sql(query, "SUM() Window Function Example")
```


```python
# AVG() and COUNT() window functions
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    sale_amount,
    AVG(sale_amount) OVER () as overall_avg,
    AVG(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_avg,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_count,
    sale_amount - AVG(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as diff_from_dept_avg
FROM sales
ORDER BY department, sale_amount DESC
"""

run_sql(query, "AVG() and COUNT() Window Functions Example")
```


```python
# MIN() and MAX() window functions
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    sale_amount,
    MIN(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_min,
    MAX(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_max,
    MAX(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) as local_max
FROM sales
ORDER BY department, sale_amount
"""

run_sql(query, "MIN() and MAX() Window Functions Example")
```

### 3. Value/Offset Functions

These functions access data from other rows relative to the current row.


```python
# LAG() and LEAD() functions
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    sale_date,
    sale_amount,
    LAG(sale_amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_name ORDER BY sale_date) as prev_sale,
    LEAD(sale_amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_name ORDER BY sale_date) as next_sale,
    sale_amount - LAG(sale_amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_name ORDER BY sale_date) as sale_change
FROM sales
WHERE employee_name IN ('Alice Johnson', 'Bob Smith', 'Carol Davis')
ORDER BY employee_name, sale_date
"""

run_sql(query, "LAG() and LEAD() Functions Example")
```


```python
# FIRST_VALUE() and LAST_VALUE() functions
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    sale_date,
    sale_amount,
    FIRST_VALUE(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY sale_date) as first_dept_sale,
    LAST_VALUE(sale_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY department 
        ORDER BY sale_date 
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) as last_dept_sale
FROM sales
ORDER BY department, sale_date
"""

run_sql(query, "FIRST_VALUE() and LAST_VALUE() Functions Example")
```


```python
# NTH_VALUE() function
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    sale_amount,
    NTH_VALUE(sale_amount, 2) OVER (
        PARTITION BY department 
        ORDER BY sale_amount DESC
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) as second_highest_in_dept
FROM sales
ORDER BY department, sale_amount DESC
"""

run_sql(query, "NTH_VALUE() Function Example")
```

## Window Frame Specifications

Window frames define which rows are included in the calculation for each row.

### Frame Types:
- `ROWS`: Physical number of rows
- `RANGE`: Logical range based on values

### Frame Boundaries:
- `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`: From the start of the partition
- `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`: To the end of the partition
- `CURRENT ROW`: The current row
- `n PRECEDING`: n rows before the current row
- `n FOLLOWING`: n rows after the current row


```python
# Different frame specifications
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    sale_date,
    sale_amount,
    -- Running total from beginning
    SUM(sale_amount) OVER (
        ORDER BY sale_date 
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as running_total,
    -- Moving average of last 3 sales
    AVG(sale_amount) OVER (
        ORDER BY sale_date 
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as moving_avg_3,
    -- Total of current and next 2 rows
    SUM(sale_amount) OVER (
        ORDER BY sale_date 
        ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 2 FOLLOWING
    ) as forward_sum
FROM sales
ORDER BY sale_date
"""

run_sql(query, "Window Frame Specifications Example")
```

## Advanced Examples

### Finding Top N in Each Group


```python
# Top 2 sales performers in each department
query = """
WITH ranked_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_name,
        department,
        SUM(sale_amount) as total_sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY SUM(sale_amount) DESC) as dept_rank
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY employee_name, department
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked_sales
WHERE dept_rank &lt;= 2
ORDER BY department, dept_rank
"""

run_sql(query, "Top 2 Sales Performers in Each Department")
```


```python
# Percentage of total and cumulative percentage
query = """
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    sale_amount,
    ROUND(
        100.0 * sale_amount / SUM(sale_amount) OVER (), 
        2
    ) as pct_of_total,
    ROUND(
        100.0 * SUM(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) / 
        SUM(sale_amount) OVER (), 
        2
    ) as cumulative_pct
FROM sales
ORDER BY sale_amount DESC
"""

run_sql(query, "Percentage of Total and Cumulative Percentage")
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Window functions don't reduce the number of rows** - unlike GROUP BY aggregates
2. **PARTITION BY** divides the result set into groups for the window function
3. **ORDER BY** within OVER determines the order for ranking and frame calculations
4. **Frame specifications** (ROWS/RANGE) control which rows are included in calculations
5. **Ranking functions** handle ties differently (ROW_NUMBER vs RANK vs DENSE_RANK)
6. **LAG/LEAD** are perfect for comparing current row with previous/next rows
7. **Window functions can be combined** with CTEs for complex analytical queries

Window functions are essential for analytical SQL and are supported by most modern databases including PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL 8.0+, and SQLite 3.25+.
