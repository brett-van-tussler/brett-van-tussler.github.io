# Welcome to my Library!

This site serves as a curated collection of my work, notes, and ideas across several domainsâ€”ranging from bioinformatics and coding to philosophy. Below is a breakdown of the key sections in this repository:

## ðŸ“Š Bioinformatics

This section includes examples of bioinformatics code that Iâ€™ve written, along with pipelines, scripts, and tools I've developed for analyzing biological data. Youâ€™ll find content related to sequencing data, variant analysis, gene expression, and more.

## ðŸ§© Code Examples

A collection of standalone code snippets and examples from various domains. These might include data wrangling, visualization tools, scripts for workflow automation, or anything else Iâ€™ve found useful and worth sharing.

## ðŸ“š Dictionary

A growing glossary of definitions and explanations. This section is divided into categories such as:
- **Bioinformatics Definitions**: Terms and techniques commonly used in genomics and computational biology.
- **Machine Learning Definitions**: Key concepts in AI and ML, including algorithm summaries, theoretical notes, and intuitive explanations.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning

Examples of machine learning code Iâ€™ve developed. These might include classification, regression, clustering, model evaluation, and applications to biological or other real-world datasets. Many of the projects here may overlap with those in the Bioinformatics section.

## ðŸŒ€ Philosophy

A more free-form section containing my thoughts, notes, and explorations of philosophical questionsâ€”often connected to scientific reasoning, epistemology, or the philosophy of AI and computation.
