Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are powerful tools used to study different layers of gene regulation and genome structure.

### ðŸ§¬ RNA-seq (RNA sequencing)

â€¢ Purpose: Measures gene expression â€” tells you which genes are being transcribed into RNA, and how much.

â€¢ Data type: Sequencing reads aligned to genes/transcripts.

â€¢ Used for: Identifying differentially expressed genes between conditions (e.g., normal vs. cancer cells).

### ðŸ§ª ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing)

â€¢ Purpose: Identifies open or accessible regions of chromatin â€” places where DNA is not tightly wrapped around histones and is more likely to be active.

â€¢ Data type: Peaks indicating open chromatin regions.

â€¢ Used for: Inferring regulatory regions like enhancers, promoters, and transcription factor binding sites.

### ðŸ”¬ ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing)

â€¢ Purpose: Maps protein-DNA interactions, such as where transcription factors or modified histones bind DNA.

â€¢ Data type: Enrichment peaks showing binding locations.

â€¢ Used for: Studying gene regulation, histone modifications, and epigenetic changes.

### ðŸ§© Hi-C (Chromosome Conformation Capture + Sequencing)

â€¢ Purpose: Reveals 3D organization of the genome by capturing DNA-DNA interactions across long distances.

â€¢ Data type: Contact maps showing spatial proximity between regions of the genome.

â€¢ Used for: Studying chromatin loops, compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs).
