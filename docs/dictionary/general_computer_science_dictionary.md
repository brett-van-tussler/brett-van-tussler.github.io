### Verilog

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used primarily for modeling, simulating, and synthesizing digital circuits and systems. It allows engineers to describe electronic systems at various levels of abstraction, from high-level behavioral descriptions to detailed gate-level implementations. Verilog is widely used in the semiconductor industry for designing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and other digital hardware. It supports both concurrent and sequential execution models, reflecting the parallel nature of hardware operations. Along with VHDL, Verilog is one of the two major HDLs used in electronic design automation (EDA) workflows for digital circuit design, verification, and implementation.
