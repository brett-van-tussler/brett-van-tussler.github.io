## Western Blot/Immunoblot

### Definition
Western blotting (immunoblotting) is a powerful analytical technique used in molecular biology and proteomics to detect, identify, and semi-quantify specific proteins within a complex mixture of proteins extracted from cells or tissues [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2144/btn-2022-0034). The technique derives its name from its position in the "blotting" family, following Southern blotting (for DNA) and Northern blotting (for RNA) [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2144/btn-2022-0034).

### Principle
Western blotting uses three key elements to accomplish protein detection [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3456489/):
1. **Separation by size**: Proteins are separated based on molecular weight through gel electrophoresis
2. **Transfer to solid support**: Separated proteins are transferred to a protein-binding membrane
3. **Immunodetection**: Target proteins are marked using specific primary and secondary antibodies for visualization

### Protocol
The Western blot procedure typically involves the following steps [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3456489/) [4](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/overview-western-blotting.html):

1. **Sample preparation**: Proteins are extracted from cells or tissues using mechanical disruption, chemical extraction, or enzymatic methods
2. **Gel electrophoresis**: Proteins are separated based on molecular weight using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), typically with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE)
3. **Protein transfer**: Separated proteins are transferred from the gel to a membrane (nitrocellulose or PVDF) using electrophoresis (electroblotting)
4. **Blocking**: The membrane is blocked with a protein solution (often non-fat dry milk or BSA) to prevent non-specific antibody binding
5. **Primary antibody incubation**: The membrane is incubated with a primary antibody specific to the target protein
6. **Washing**: Unbound primary antibodies are washed away
7. **Secondary antibody incubation**: The membrane is incubated with a labeled secondary antibody that binds to the primary antibody
8. **Detection**: The protein-antibody complex is visualized using various detection methods

### Detection Methods
Several detection methods can be used in Western blotting [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2144/btn-2022-0034) [4](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/overview-western-blotting.html):

1. **Chromogenic detection**: Uses enzyme-conjugated secondary antibodies (like HRP or AP) that produce a colored precipitate when exposed to a substrate
2. **Chemiluminescent detection**: Uses enzyme-conjugated antibodies that produce light when exposed to a substrate, captured on film or by digital imaging systems
3. **Fluorescent detection**: Uses fluorophore-conjugated antibodies that emit light when excited at specific wavelengths
4. **Radioactive detection**: Historically used radioactive probes and autoradiography film (less common today)

### Applications
Western blotting has numerous applications in research and clinical settings [5](https://microbenotes.com/western-blot/) [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot):

1. **Protein identification and characterization**: Detecting specific proteins in complex mixtures
2. **Post-translational modifications**: Identifying modifications like phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination
3. **Protein expression analysis**: Measuring relative protein levels in different samples
4. **Clinical diagnostics**: Confirming diseases like HIV through antibody detection
5. **Drug development**: Evaluating protein targets and drug effects
6. **Epitope mapping**: Identifying antibody binding sites on proteins
7. **Anti-doping testing**: Detecting prohibited substances in sports

### Advantages
1. Requires only small amounts of reagents [5](https://microbenotes.com/western-blot/)
2. High specificity due to antibody-antigen interactions [4](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/overview-western-blotting.html)
3. Provides information about protein molecular weight [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2144/btn-2022-0034)
4. Same protein transfer can be used for multiple analyses [5](https://microbenotes.com/western-blot/)
5. Can detect proteins at picogram levels with optimized protocols

### Limitations
1. Requires specific antibodies for target proteins [5](https://microbenotes.com/western-blot/)
2. Potential for antibody cross-reactivity and off-target effects [5](https://microbenotes.com/western-blot/)
3. Time-consuming procedure (typically 1-2 days) [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2144/btn-2022-0034)
4. Semi-quantitative rather than fully quantitative [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2144/btn-2022-0034)
5. Relatively costly due to antibody expenses and detection reagents [5](https://microbenotes.com/western-blot/)
