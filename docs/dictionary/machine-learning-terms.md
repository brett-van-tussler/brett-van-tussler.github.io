A learning method where the AI system finds patterns in unlabeled data without explicit guidance. It's like discovering categories or relationships naturally. Important for data clustering, anomaly detection, and understanding hidden patterns in data.

### 📈 Overfitting
A common problem in machine learning where a model learns the training data too precisely, including its noise and irregularities. This reduces its ability to generalize to new data, like memorizing answers instead of understanding the underlying concepts.

### ⬇️ Gradient Descent
A fundamental optimization algorithm used to train machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts the model's parameters to minimize errors, like finding the bottom of a valley by taking small steps downhill. This process is crucial for training neural networks effectively.

### ↩️ Backpropagation
The core learning algorithm for neural networks that calculates how much each neuron contributed to the error, then adjusts weights backwards through the network. It's like tracing back through a chain of decisions to identify and correct mistakes, enabling efficient network training.

### 👁️ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A specialized neural network architecture inspired by the visual cortex. It uses sliding filters to automatically learn and detect important features in grid-like data (especially images), making it powerful for tasks like facial recognition, object detection, and medical image analysis.

### 🔄 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
A neural network designed for sequential data that maintains a "memory" of previous inputs. Like having a short-term memory, it processes information in order and uses past context to understand current inputs, making it suitable for tasks like text prediction and time series analysis.

### 🧠 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
An advanced RNN architecture that solves the "vanishing gradient" problem, allowing it to remember important information for longer sequences. It uses specialized gates to control information flow, making it excellent for tasks requiring long-term memory like language translation and speech recognition.

### 🎨 Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
An AI architecture where two networks compete: one creates fake data, while the other tries to distinguish real from fake. This competition drives both to improve, resulting in increasingly realistic synthetic data. GANs have revolutionized AI-generated art, deepfakes, and synthetic data generation.

### 🗜️ Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
A generative model that learns to compress data into a compact representation and then reconstruct it. Unlike regular autoencoders, VAEs learn smooth, continuous representations that allow meaningful data generation and manipulation. They're vital for tasks like image generation and data compression.

### 👀 Attention Mechanism
A breakthrough technique that allows neural networks to focus on relevant parts of input data, similar to human attention. By learning which parts of the input are important for each output, it dramatically improves performance in tasks like translation and image captioning. This mechanism is a key component of transformer architectures.

### 📍 Positional Encoding
A technique that adds location information to data in neural networks, helping them understand the order and structure of sequences. It's crucial for transformer models to process ordered data like text or time series, as it provides context about where each piece of information belongs in the sequence.

### ⌨️ Prompt Engineering
The art and science of crafting effective inputs for large language models to achieve desired outputs. It involves understanding model behavior and using specific techniques to guide the model's responses, crucial for getting optimal results from AI systems.

### 🔢 Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)
A specialized hardware accelerator developed by Google specifically for neural network machine learning. TPUs are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed to accelerate tensor operations, which are fundamental to deep learning models. Unlike CPUs and GPUs, TPUs are optimized for matrix operations with high computational throughput and lower precision, making them significantly faster and more energy-efficient for AI workloads.

TPUs play a crucial role in training and running Google's Gemini models, providing the massive computational power needed to process the enormous datasets required for large language models. Their architecture enables parallel processing at scale, reducing training time from weeks to days or hours, and allowing for more efficient inference when deploying these models in production environments.

### 📊 Mixed-Effects Models
A statistical framework that incorporates both fixed effects (parameters that apply to an entire population) and random effects (parameters specific to individual groups or subjects within the data). These models are particularly valuable for analyzing hierarchical, nested, or longitudinal data where observations are not fully independent. Mixed-effects models account for both within-group and between-group variations, making them powerful tools for fields like medicine, ecology, and social sciences where data often has complex, multi-level structures.

By simultaneously modeling group-level and individual-level effects, these models provide more accurate parameter estimates and standard errors than traditional regression approaches when dealing with clustered data. They're especially useful for repeated measures designs, panel data, and any scenario where measurements are taken from the same subjects over time or under different conditions.

Example:
A mixed-effects model could be used to predict the progression of Alzheimer's disease by analyzing longitudinal MRI data, incorporating patient-specific factors and overall trends. 

### 🔬 Mechanistic Modeling
An approach to modeling that incorporates known physical, chemical, or biological processes to explain phenomena, rather than relying solely on statistical patterns in data. Unlike purely data-driven approaches, mechanistic models are built on theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms that generate the observed data. These models attempt to represent causal relationships and system dynamics based on first principles.

Mechanistic models are particularly valuable in scientific domains where understanding the "why" and "how" is as important as prediction accuracy. They offer greater interpretability and can often extrapolate beyond the range of observed data more reliably than black-box statistical models. In machine learning, mechanistic approaches are increasingly being combined with data-driven methods to create hybrid models that benefit from both theoretical knowledge and empirical patterns, especially in fields like computational biology, climate science, and physics-informed neural networks.

Flight Simulator:
A flight simulator uses mathematical equations to recreate the experience of flying a plane, demonstrating a real-world application of a mechanistic model.
Chromatography Model:
In chromatography, mechanistic models consider physical and biochemical effects like convection, dispersion, and adsorption, based on natural laws

A machine learning model (e.g., a neural network) can be trained to predict cell phenotypes (e.g., cell growth, cell death) based on the outputs of the mechanistic model, which include changes in protein localization, phosphorylation, and downstream effects

### 📊 Tensor Decomposition
A mathematical approach for breaking down multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) into simpler components, similar to how matrix factorization works for two-dimensional data. Tensor decompositions reveal underlying patterns and structures in complex multi-way data, making them powerful tools for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and latent factor discovery in unsupervised learning.

Tensor methods are particularly valuable for analyzing data with multiple aspects or modes (such as users-items-time in recommendation systems or subjects-features-time in neuroimaging), where traditional matrix methods would lose important multi-way relationships.

### 🧩 Tucker Decomposition
A higher-order extension of principal component analysis (PCA) that decomposes a tensor into a core tensor multiplied by a matrix along each mode. Tucker decomposition provides a more flexible representation than other tensor methods, allowing different ranks for different dimensions.

In unsupervised learning, Tucker decomposition excels at subspace learning and dimensionality reduction for multi-way data, enabling applications like multi-aspect data mining, anomaly detection in network traffic, and feature extraction from multi-modal signals.

### 🔄 Canonical Polyadic (CP) Decomposition
Also known as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition, CP breaks down a tensor into a sum of rank-one tensors (outer products of vectors). This decomposition provides a highly interpretable representation where each component represents a distinct pattern or factor in the data.

CP decomposition serves as a powerful unsupervised learning tool for discovering latent factors in multi-way data, with applications in chemometrics (analyzing chemical measurements), neuroscience (identifying functional networks), and recommendation systems (capturing user-item-context interactions).

### 🌐 Generalized CP (GCP) Decomposition
An extension of the standard CP decomposition that incorporates different loss functions and constraints to handle various data types (binary, count, continuous) and missing values. GCP provides more flexibility for modeling complex real-world data with non-Gaussian characteristics.

In unsupervised learning, GCP enables robust pattern discovery in heterogeneous multi-way data, supporting applications like topic modeling across document collections, community detection in dynamic networks, and analyzing sparse, noisy biological measurements across multiple experimental conditions.

### 📊 Lasso Regression
A linear regression technique that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability. Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) adds an L1 penalty term to the cost function, which can shrink some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively removing less important features from the model. This feature selection capability makes Lasso particularly valuable for high-dimensional datasets where many features may be irrelevant or redundant.

Lasso Regression is widely used in fields like genomics (selecting relevant genetic markers), finance (identifying key economic indicators), and image processing (extracting important features while discarding noise).

### 📈 Ridge Regression
A regularization technique that addresses multicollinearity in linear regression by adding an L2 penalty term to the cost function. Unlike Lasso, Ridge Regression shrinks coefficients toward zero but rarely sets them exactly to zero, keeping all features in the model while reducing their impact. This approach is particularly effective when dealing with highly correlated predictors, preventing the model from assigning excessive importance to any single variable.

Ridge Regression excels in scenarios where all features contribute to the outcome but need to be constrained to prevent overfitting, such as in economic forecasting, climate modeling, and biomedical research.

### 🔀 Elastic Net
A hybrid regression technique that combines the penalties of both Lasso and Ridge Regression, incorporating both L1 and L2 regularization terms. This balanced approach overcomes limitations of each method alone: it can select variables like Lasso while handling groups of correlated features better, similar to Ridge. The mixing parameter allows data scientists to tune the model between pure Lasso and pure Ridge behavior.

Elastic Net is particularly valuable for complex datasets with many correlated features, such as in genomics (where groups of genes may work together), neuroimaging (where brain regions have correlated activities), and recommendation systems (where user preferences show complex patterns).
