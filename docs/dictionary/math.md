### üìä Parametric Statistics
Statistical methods that assume data comes from a population following a probability distribution based on a fixed set of parameters. These methods make specific assumptions about the data's distribution (often assuming normal distribution) and draw inferences about the parameters of the assumed distribution. Examples include t-tests, ANOVA, and linear regression.

Parametric methods are generally more powerful when their assumptions are met but may produce misleading results when these assumptions are violated.

### üìà Non-parametric Statistics
Statistical techniques that don't rely on assumptions about the underlying population distribution. These methods are distribution-free and typically based on ranks or orders rather than the actual values. Examples include the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Spearman's rank correlation.

Non-parametric methods are more robust and flexible, making them suitable when data doesn't meet parametric assumptions or when working with ordinal data, but they may have less statistical power when parametric assumptions are valid.

### üîê Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
A cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel without requiring a prior shared secret. It relies on the mathematical principles of modular exponentiation and the computational difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem.

The protocol works by having both parties generate private keys, derive public keys using modular exponentiation, exchange these public keys, and then independently compute the same shared secret. This method is fundamental to many secure communications systems and was the first practical implementation of public key cryptography. It's widely used in secure protocols like HTTPS, SSH, IPsec, and TLS to establish encrypted communication channels.

### üîì Small Subgroup Vulnerabilities
A cryptographic weakness that can occur in implementations of protocols using discrete logarithm-based cryptography, particularly Diffie-Hellman key exchange. These vulnerabilities arise when an attacker forces computations into a small subgroup of the larger cryptographic group, making it feasible to determine the private key through brute force methods.

Small subgroup attacks exploit improper parameter validation, specifically when implementations fail to verify that received public keys are members of the correct cryptographic group of appropriate order. By sending carefully crafted invalid public values, attackers can extract information about the victim's private key through multiple protocol interactions. Proper implementation requires validation of all public keys and the use of safe primes or prime order subgroups to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

### üßÆ Pohlig-Hellman Algorithm
An algorithm for computing discrete logarithms in a cyclic group, particularly useful when the order of the group has only small prime factors. Developed by Stephen Pohlig and Martin Hellman in 1978, it significantly reduces the computational complexity of the discrete logarithm problem in certain groups.

The algorithm works by decomposing the discrete logarithm problem in a group of composite order into smaller subproblems in groups of prime order using the Chinese remainder theorem. It then solves these smaller problems using techniques like the baby-step giant-step algorithm. While highly efficient for groups whose order factors into small primes, it's ineffective against groups specifically chosen for cryptographic purposes (those with at least one large prime factor). Understanding this algorithm is crucial for cryptographers to select appropriate parameters for discrete logarithm-based cryptosystems like Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal.

### üß© Chinese Remainder Theorem
A fundamental result in number theory that provides a solution to systems of simultaneous linear congruences with coprime moduli. The theorem states that if one has several congruence equations, a unique solution exists modulo the product of the moduli, provided that the moduli are pairwise coprime.

Formally, if n‚ÇÅ, n‚ÇÇ, ..., n‚Çñ are pairwise coprime positive integers and a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, ..., a‚Çñ are any integers, then the system of congruences x ‚â° a‚ÇÅ (mod n‚ÇÅ), x ‚â° a‚ÇÇ (mod n‚ÇÇ), ..., x ‚â° a‚Çñ (mod n‚Çñ) has a unique solution modulo N = n‚ÇÅ √ó n‚ÇÇ √ó ... √ó n‚Çñ.

The theorem has applications in various fields including cryptography (RSA algorithm), coding theory, and computer science (particularly in distributed computing and for creating efficient algorithms). It also has historical significance, originating in ancient Chinese mathematics as early as the 3rd century CE in the mathematical text "Sunzi Suanjing."
