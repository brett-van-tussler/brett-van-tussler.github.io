### ðŸ“Š Parametric Statistics
Statistical methods that assume data comes from a population following a probability distribution based on a fixed set of parameters. These methods make specific assumptions about the data's distribution (often assuming normal distribution) and draw inferences about the parameters of the assumed distribution. Examples include t-tests, ANOVA, and linear regression.

Parametric methods are generally more powerful when their assumptions are met but may produce misleading results when these assumptions are violated.

### ðŸ“ˆ Non-parametric Statistics
Statistical techniques that don't rely on assumptions about the underlying population distribution. These methods are distribution-free and typically based on ranks or orders rather than the actual values. Examples include the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Spearman's rank correlation.

Non-parametric methods are more robust and flexible, making them suitable when data doesn't meet parametric assumptions or when working with ordinal data, but they may have less statistical power when parametric assumptions are valid.
