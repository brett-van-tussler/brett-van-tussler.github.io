### Stochastic
In simple terms, "stochastic" refers to processes or systems that are random or inherently unpredictable, but they follow some statistical patterns or probabilities. Stochastic systems don't have a single, fixed outcome; instead, their behavior or outcomes are governed by chance and probability distributions.

The term is widely used in fields like mathematics, biology, finance, and physics, where randomness and uncertainty are present.
