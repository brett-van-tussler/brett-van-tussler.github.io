    "definition": "A fundamental rule in calculus for computing the derivative of composite functions. If you have a composite function f(g(x)), the chain rule states that the derivative is f'(g(x)) × g'(x). This rule is essential in backpropagation algorithms used in a neural network.",

    "definition": "A measure of how a function changes as its input changes. Formally, the derivative of a function f at point x is the limit of the ratio of the change in f to the change in x as the change in x approaches zero.
