    "definition": "• Definition: A neurobiological theory that explains how synaptic connections between neurons are strengthened through repeated and persistent stimulation, often summarized as \"cells that fire together, wire together.\"\n\n• Core principle:\n  - Synaptic plasticity: When two neurons are repeatedly active at the same time, the synaptic connection between them becomes stronger\n  - Activity-dependent modification: The strength of neural connections depends on the correlation of activity between pre- and post-synaptic neurons\n  - Learning mechanism: Forms the basis for associative learning and memory formation\n\n• Mathematical formulation:\n  - Hebbian learning rule: Δw = η × x × y (where Δw is the change in synaptic weight, η is the learning rate, x is pre-synaptic activity, y is post-synaptic activity)\n  - Long-term potentiation (LTP): Persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity\n  - Long-term depression (LTD): Weakening of synaptic connections when neurons fire out of sync\n\n• Applications in computational neuroscience:\n  - Artificial neural networks: Hebbian learning algorithms for unsupervised learning\n  - Self-organizing maps: Neural network architectures that use Hebbian principles for pattern recognition\n  - Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP): Refined models that consider the precise timing of neural spikes\n  - Memory models: Computational frameworks for understanding how memories are stored and retrieved\n\n• Biological significance:\n  - Development: Critical for proper neural circuit formation during brain development\n  - Learning and memory: Fundamental mechanism underlying associative learning and memory consolidation\n  - Adaptation: Allows neural circuits to adapt to environmental changes and experiences\n  - Pathology: Dysregulation implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases\n\n• Modern extensions:\n  - Spike-timing dependent plasticity: Considers the precise timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes\n  - Homeostatic plasticity: Mechanisms that maintain overall neural activity within functional ranges\n  - Metaplasticity: Changes in the ability to induce synaptic plasticity based on prior synaptic activity\n  - Computational implementations: Machine learning algorithms inspired by Hebbian principles",
